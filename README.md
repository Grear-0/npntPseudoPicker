# npntPseudoPicker
**Presse ze Tartine and have fun !**

Official npnt's pseudos picker is made in processing

**npnt** is a steam group that speak the "Baguette language". This utility is made for faciliting our intern deliriums.

## Editing nicknames
Just go to `datas/pseudos.dat` and edit the file right in your favourite **text editor**.
A star before a name mean that pseudo is already taken by a friend.

Later, an editor will come to facilitate this.

## Dependencies
I use [Interfascia](https://github.com/brendanberg/interfascia) for some GUI elements.
